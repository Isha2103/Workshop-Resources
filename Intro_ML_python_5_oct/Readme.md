## #Python<br />

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms.
Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java. Programmers have to type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time.
Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.
The biggest strength of the Python is large library which can be used for the following
Machine Learning
GUI Applications (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc. )
Web frameworks like Django (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox)
Image processing (like OpenCV, Pillow)
Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
Test frameworks
Multimedia
Scientific computing
Text processing and many more..

[Loops](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/loops-in-python/):Python programming language provides following types of loops to handle looping requirements. Python provides three ways for executing the loops. While all the ways provide similar basic functionality, they differ in their syntax and condition checking time.<br />
[Functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functions-in-python/):A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function, so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.
Python provides built-in functions like print(), etc. but we can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.<br />
[Modules](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm):A module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference.<br />



<b>#Numpy</b><br/>
Numpy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
Besides its obvious scientific uses, Numpy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.

<b>#Pandas</b><br/>
Pandas is an opensource library that allows to you perform data manipulation in Python. Pandas library is built on top of Numpy, meaning Pandas needs Numpy to operate. Pandas provide an easy way to create, manipulate and wrangle the data. Pandas is also an elegant solution for time series data.

<b>#Pytorch</b><br/>
PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It is primarily developed by Facebook's artificial intelligence research group. It is free and open-source software released under the Modified BSD license.
